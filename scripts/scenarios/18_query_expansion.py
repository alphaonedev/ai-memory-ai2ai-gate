Scenario 18 — Semantic query expansion.

alice + bob write semantically-related-but-keyword-distinct memories.
charlie issues /api/v1/recall with a semantic prompt and must see both
markers. Tests HNSW + embedder across the federated mesh.

RecallQuery reads the query string via `?context=<text>` (per
ai-memory-mcp src/models.rs:210).

v3r25 evidence showed alice's memory surfaced on charlie but bob's
did not (asymmetric). Root cause was fanout-or-embed race on node-3
for the second write — 15 s flat-wait was enough for alice (first
write, more post-settle time) but sometimes not for bob (written
closer to the settle boundary).

Fix in this iteration: poll for BOTH rows to be present on node-3's
list_memories before issuing the semantic recall. Adds an upper
wait of ~30 s (much less in practice). Without both rows present on
the querying node, the semantic test has no chance.
